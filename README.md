  **Note:** *This is a presentation of the logistic regression model and uses sources cited at the bottom of the page*

## Introduction

Logistic Regression is a simple **machine leaning** model that is used when the dependent variable meaning the target is categorical.<br> 
It is also used in both Machine Learning and Mathematical Statistics as a modeling of probability of a discrete outcome given an input variable.<br>
For example Logistic Regression can predict if an email is spam (output of 1) or not (output of 0). A Machine Learning model that's often compared to Logistic Regression is Linear Regression. The difference is that this model predicts with an output of 0 or 1, whereas the latter outpus a percentage of likelihood.

## Model

Output = 0 or 1<br>
Hypothesis: ``Z = WX +B``<br>
h$\theta$(x) = sigmoid(Z)<br>
